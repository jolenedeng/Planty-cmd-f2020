Planty is a Cmd-f 2020 hackathon project that aims to make the world greener by encouraging growth of plants native to your local area.

&nbsp;

### Inspiration
In today’s world, environmentalism is certainly a hot-topic when it comes to discussing global crises. People are concerned about the health of the environment, but how can one accomplish that beyond taking in nebulous slogans such as “Be green!” A recent study has found that 53% of total average household water use in California ( >190 gallons/day) was used for landscaping and other outdoor uses. Gardens all over the world are using non-native plants, unfit for the local climate and using more water than necessary. So how can we change this? How can we encourage the use of native plants by gardeners, landscapers, and developers?

### What it does
You can build your personalized garden with Planty! Start with searching for plants that are local to your area and Planty will provide you with all you need to know about how to take care of your plant!
